## Prerequisites
- Install Omarchy by downloading the iso. 
- Git and wget installed.

```bash
https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/50/getting-started 
```
2. Clone this repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/martinshields/opsys.git
```

3. Run the setup script:

```bash
./run.sh
```
4. After the setup is complete, you can reboot your system to see the changes.

5. Check out Typecrafts video to setup timeshift and btrfs backups.
