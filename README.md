## Prerequisites
- Install Omarchy by downloading the iso. 
- Git and wget installed.
- Internet connection
- sudo privileges

## Installation

1. Install Omarchy by downloading the iso. No more bare install. So i added run-omarchy-cleaner.sh you can run later.

```bash
https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual/50/getting-started 
```
2. Clone this repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/martinshields/opsys.git
```

3. Run the setup script:

```bash
./run.sh
```
4. After the setup is complete, you can reboot your system to see the changes.

5. Added scripts: run-omarchy-cleaner.sh (for removing bloat software). install_deluge_arch.sh (for setting up docker,lazydocker and deluge.)

6. Vbox setting for monitor if needed.

```bash
monitor=VGA-1,1920x1080@60.0,1920x1080,1.2
```
